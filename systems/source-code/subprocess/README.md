# Executing external programs or shell commands

Executing external programs or shell commands can conveniently be done
using Python's `subprocess` module in the standard library.  It allows
to send input to the external command (if necessary), and capture
what is sent to standard output and/or standard error by that command.
The exit code can also be retrieved.

## What is it?

1. `wc_metrics.py`: this script computes the number of characters, words, and
  lines in a file using the shell's `wc` commaand.
1. `async_handling.py`: this script illustrates how to monitor the standard error
   generated by a subprocess.
1. `process.sh`: Bash script to execute by `async_handling.py`.
