# Jinja

Jinja2 is a templating library for Python that can be used for reporting,
or for any coding task that boils down to filling out templates.

## What is it?

1. `reporting.py`: Python script that creates either a MarkDown or HTML format
   report on randomly generated people.  The data reported is a person's ID,
   year of birth and number of friends.
1. `population/templates/report.html`: template for the HTML report.
1. `population/templates/report.md`: template for the MarkDown report.
